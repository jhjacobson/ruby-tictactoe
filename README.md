# ruby-tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe implemented in Ruby

The game can be played by performing the following steps (assuming you have Ruby installed)
1) Download the repo
2) Open a terminal window and change your directory to the folder with tictactoe.rb
3) Run 'irb -r ./tictactoe.rb'
4) Type play_game and hit enter

This is a first pass of an implementation. Lots of cleanup that needs to be done at this point.
